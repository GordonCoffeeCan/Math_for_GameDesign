WASD to rotate the player.

Capture the dots have the same color of the player.

Rules:

Captured the dot has the same color, gain 1 score.
Captured the dot has the different color, lose 1 score.
Bounced the dot has the same color, lose 1 score.
Bounced the dot has the different color, won't gain or lose the score.

This project is only the demo of my concept.

To get a better experience, playing with Xbox One or Xbox 360 controller.
